As my objective is to predict the level of depression and level of anxiety on the basis of unhealthy bad habits or lifestyle & find the correlation between depression and anxiety ,so I have to use an "amount of depression" measuring scale and an "amount of anxiety" measuring scale PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scale. 
The PHQ-9 is the 9 -question depression scale of PHQ. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a multiple-choice, self-report inventory that is used as a screening and diagnostic tool for mental health disorders of depression, anxiety, eating, etc. Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) is a self reported questionnaire for screening and severity measuring of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). So, I find correlation coefficient and scatter diagram between PHQ-9 score and GAD-7 score. 
Finally I fit a model to test the PHQ-9 score based on the effect of Anxiety. It is quite possible to take just only the GAD-7 Score as independent variable but my interest is to know the exact effect of the each and every anxiety related issues.
